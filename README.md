# Hi, I’m ExtraSoupGames
I am a passionate game developer interested in using and making tools to bring unique game ideas to life

## Tools
I have previously used exclusively Unity, but after learning C# and monogame, I branched out to my current toolset which consists of:
- Godot
- C++
- SDL3
- Typescript
- Babylon.js
- C#
- Unity

## Active Projects
### [Due Process](https://dueprocess.info)
I have been a contributor to Due Process since July 2025, fixing bugs and improving player experience for a large scale project in Unity with C#
